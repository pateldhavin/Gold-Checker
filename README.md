# Gold-Checker

Overview

Gold Price Tracker is a simple Python program that retrieves the current price of gold (XAUUSD) using the Alpha Vantage API and continuously tracks its changes. The program fetches the gold price from the API, logs it with a timestamp, and saves the data to a file named "price_changes.txt". Additionally, it prints the current price to the console at regular intervals.
